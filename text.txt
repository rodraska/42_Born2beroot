"apt install sudo" apt - advanced packaging tool. It's designed to handle software installation and removal. It is a command-line tool with no GUI. Whenever invoked from command line along with the name of the package to be installed, it finds that package along with the list of its dependencies and automatically installs them thus lettig users not worry of installing dependencies. Aptitude is a front-end advanced packaging tool, adding a user interface to the funcionality. Aptitude is a high-level packaging manager while APT is a lower-leval packaging manager. High level language is easily understandable by humans, while low level language is understandable by machines. sudo (superuser do) is a program that enables users to run programs with the security privileges of another user, by default the superuser. 
"dpkg -l | grep sudo" dpkg is a tool to install, build, remove and manage Debian packages. -l option lists packages matching given pattern. | (Pipe) is a form  of redirection used in Unix-like OS to send output of one command/program/process to another for further processing. It's used to combine two or more commands; the output of one command acts and the input to another command. This direct connection allows the commands to operate simultaneously and permits data to be transferred between them continuously. Pipes are unidirectional, data flows from left to right through the pipeline. grep searches for patterns in each file. it prints each line that matches a pattern.
"adduser rreis-de sudo" adduser is a command to add a new user to the current linux machine. By default, a group will also be created for the new user. sudo group is a group of superusers that have privileged access to root commands.

User rreis-de now has sudo priviliges updated. From now on, run root-privileged commands via prefix "sudo"
"sudo apt update" updates the package sources lits with the lastest versions of the packages in the repositories.

"Defaults	logfile="/var/log/sudo/sudolog"" this logs all sudo commands to this file; logs provide a timeline of events for the Linux OS and are a valuable troubleshooting tool.
"Defaults	log_input,log_output"
"Defaults	iolog_dir=/var/log/sudo" Archives all sudo inputs and ouputs to this directory.
"Defaults	requiretty" requires TTY. tty command is used to check if the output medium is a terminal. the command prints the file name of the terminal connected to stdin.

SSH

"sudo apt install openssh-server" OpenSSH is a suite of secure networking utilities based on the Secure Shell protocol, which provides a secure channel over an unsecure network in a client-server architecture.

"sudo ufw enable" enable firewall
"sudo ufw deny 4242" deny incomming connections using port 4242
"sudo ufw allow 4242" allow incomming connections using Port 4242

"hostname -I" hostname shows the system's hostname. use -I to display ip address of host
"ssh rreis-de@10.12.179.82 -p 4242" connect to a server via ssh. ssh is a program for logging into a remote machine and for executing commands on a remote machine. ssh connects and logs into the specified destination. -p specifies the port to connect to on the remote host.
"exit" terminate SSH session

USER MANAGEMENT

"sudo vi /etc/login.defs" open the file in given directory. login.defs defines the site-specific configuration for the shadow password suite.

"df -Bg | grep '^/dev/' | grep -v '/boot$' | awk '{td+=$2} {ud+=$3} END {printf("%d", ud/td*100)}'"
"uptime | awk '{printf("%.1f%%", $(NF-2)})'" uptime gives a one line display with the following info: current time, how long the system has been running, how many users are logged on, the system load averages for the past 1, 5 and 15 min.
